# SpaceGame
Aster's Great Space Adventure.  

This is a text-based console game that we created as our final project for COP2551.   
It is written in C# and uses the .NET Core 3.1 Framework.

Although this originated as a last-minute class assignment, we are slowly adding bits to it, so that eventually it could reach it's potential.
